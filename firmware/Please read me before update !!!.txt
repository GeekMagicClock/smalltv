For version earlier than V3.0.33 can only be updated to V3.0.33, if you update it to V3.1.X, there will be 404 error if you visit the web console.
Still you can update it back, via http://ip_of_your_clock/update.

V3.0.X has different software structure with the V3.1.X, they should not be updated to each other.

Thank you.
